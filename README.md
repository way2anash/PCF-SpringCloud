## Course Overview

******* Course Overview *******

How about learning PCF (Pivotal Cloud Foundry)  deploying Spring Applications to Cloud using Pivotal Cloud Foundry?

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) provides a great cloud native platform to deploy Spring Boot Applications.

Spring Boot is the No 1 Java Framework to develop REST API and Microservices. 

In this course, we deploy a variety of Spring Boot Applications to the Cloud:
- REST APIs - Hello World and Todo - Jar
- Todo Web Application War
- Full Stack Application with React and Spring Boot
- CCS and CES Microservices
- Route Services

This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to PCF and the Cloud.

You will be using deploying a variety of projects to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) . These projects are created with  React (Frontend Framework), Spring Boot (REST API Framework), Spring (Dependency Management), Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization - Basic and JWT), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies management), Node (npm), Visual Studio Code (TypeScript IDE), Eclipse (Java IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.
